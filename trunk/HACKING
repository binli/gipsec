guidelines for gipsec
====================

Please don't commit directly to the subversion repository unless
you have been given the green light to commit freely to gipsec. 
When in doubt assume you haven't ;-).

Please attach patches in http://code.google.com/p/gipsec/issues/list
If the patch fixes a bug that is not reported yet in bugzilla or is
an enhancement, create a new bugreport.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  I really appreciate
your help, I just want to review these fixes before applying.

If you are a "build sheriff", feel free to commit fixes for build and 
configure (please, send me an e-mail with the patch you have applied).

Thanks
Bin Li
